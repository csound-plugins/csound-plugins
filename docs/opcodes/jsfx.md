# jsfx

## Abstract

Instantiates and runs a jsfx script 


## Description

`jsfx` allows to instantiate and run a jsfx audio plugin within csound. 

There are two ways to run a jsfx script in csound. The simplest way is implemented
in this plugin, `jsfx`, which allows to compile and control a jsfx plugin in one
opcode. As an alternative, it is also possible to decouple these actions, first 
compiling a script (see [jsfx_new]) and then calling `jsfx_setslider` and `jsfx_play`.
Afterwords, slider values can be read via `jsfx_getslider`

!!! Note "jsfx"

    `jsfx` is an audio programming language implemented pritarily as part of the DAW `REAPER`. 
    It is a scriptiong language with a built-in jit compiler which translates it to 
    machine code on the fly. It allows the user to operate at the sample level (like 
    defining an udo with `setksmps 1` but more efficient). It is around 2x to 2.5x slower
    than hand-coded C.

    
!!! Note "jsfx inputs and outputs"

    A jsfx script has a certain number of audio input / output channels, and a series of 
    "sliders", which are parameters operating at control rate. A script can also use
    these sliders to send control values, which can be read in csound via [jsfx_getslider]
    See https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php for more information about the syntax, etc.


## Syntax

    ihandle, aout1 [, aout2, ...]  jsfx Spath, ain1 [, ain2, ...] [, id0, kval1, id1, kval2, ...]
    
### Arguments

* **Spath**: the path to the jsfx script. Either an absolute path, a relative path to the 
  .csd file, or a filename alone, in which case it will be searched first in the current dir
  and in $SSDIR, if defined.
* **ain1**, **ain2**, etc: audio input channels. It is recommended that the number of input
  streams matches the number of channels expected in the plugin. If you pass less that the 
  expected channels, the rest will be zeroed, and if passing more, only the number of 
  audio channels expected by the plugin will actually be processed
* **idx**, **kvalx**: a jsfx script allows to define up to 64 control parameters, which are
  called `slider`s. Each slider has an idx (starting from 1) and a value. Here you can control
  as many sliders as you need. Each slider consists of a pair of values, an id (i- value) 
  identifying the slider (this corresponds to the sliderx value in the jsfx script) and the
  value itself (a k- value)

### Output

* **ihandle**: a handle to the jsfx plugin created, which allows to operate on it later,
  for instance to read slider values via [jsfx_getslider]
* **aout1**, **aout2**: audio output channels. It is recommended that the number of output
  streams matches the number of channels expected in the plugin. If you pass less that the 
  expected channels, the rest will be zeroed, and if passing more, only the number of 
  audio channels expected by the plugin will actually be processed

### Execution Time

* Performance (audio)
