# pool_new

## Abstract

Create an empty  pool


## Description

A pool is actually a stack of numbers, based on an array.

The pool_ opcodes implement a stack of numbers. This is useful when assigning
ids to resources, like assigning fractional numbers to instrument instances to
access them individually. `pool_new` creates an empty pool. To use the pool it
must be first filled with values via `pool_push`. If a size is given, a pool of
the given size is allocated and the size can't be modified. If no size is given,
a pool of variable size is created.


!!! Note "Variable size / fixed size"

    A variable size pool produces allocations during performance, which might be
    a problem in certain situations / architectures or when running in `--realtime`
    mode. 


## Syntax

    ipool pool_new isize=0

### Arguments

* `isize`: the size of the pool. If leaved out or set as 0, a pool of variable
  size is created. Values can be pushed via `pool_push` and the pool will grow
  to accomodate these.

### Output

* `ipool`: an index identifying this pool. This index is used when calling any
  `pool` opcode

### Execution Time

* Init

; create an empty global pool of fixed capacity.

  isize pool_size gipool
  print isize
