# dict_size

## Abstract

Returns the number of key:value pairs in a dict

## Description

A hashtable is a mapping from a key to a value. The `dict_` family of opcodes 
implement a hashtable mapping either strings or integers to strings or floats. 

`dict_size` returns the number of such key:value pairs inside a dict. If the handle
passed does not point to a valid dict, `dict_size` returns -1. It is thus possible
to use it to check that the passed handle is valid (similar to `dict_query idict "exists"`,
see [dict_query](dict_query.md))

`dict_size` can be used together with [dict_iter](dict_iter) to iterate over the key:value
pairs 

## Syntax

    isize dict_size idict
    ksize dict_size idict
    
`dict_size` executes both at **i-time** and **k-time**. 

### Arguments

* `Ã¬dict`: the handle of the dict, as returned by `dict_new`

### Output

* `ksize`: the number of key:value pairs in the dict


### Execution Time

* Init 
* Performance

  ; create a local dict, mapping strings to numbers

  ; set key a key:value pair
  dict_set idict, "bar", 123
  
  ksize = dict_size(idict)
  printf "size: %d", 1, ksize
  
  dict_set idict, "foo", 4
  ksize = dict_size(idict)
  printf "size: %d", 1, ksize
  
  ; size does not change now
  dict_set idict, "foo", 10
  ksize = dict_size(idict)
  printf "size: %d", 1, ksize
  
  ; we delete a key, size is reduced
  dict_set idict, "foo"
  ksize = dict_size(idict)
  printf "size: %d", 1, ksize
  
  turnoff
