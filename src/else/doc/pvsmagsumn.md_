# pvsmagsumn

## Abstract

Sum the magnitudes of the n loudest bins

## Description

Sum the magnitudes of the loudest bins between given frequencies

Can be used to calculate how much energy is concentrated on the
loudest `inumbins` bins. The ratio between this value and the
sum of all magnitudes is a good indicator of how spread out
the energy of the signal is across the frequency spectrum, thus
serving as a good measure for the noisyness of the signal.
A noisy signal will tend to have energy spread more evenly across
the spectrum, while a musical or speech signal will concentrate
that signal along a limited range of bins.
This opcode combines in one the use of pvstrace and pvsmagsum
making it more efficient for the use cases where the spectrum
of the selected bins is not actually needed.

## Syntax


```csound
ktotalmag pvsmagsum fsig, inumbins, kminfreq=0, kmaxfreq=sr/2
```

## Arguments

* **fsig**: Input pv stream.
* **inumbins**: Number of bins to select
* **kminfreq**: min. freq to considere
* **kmaxfreq**: max. freq to considere

## Output

* **ktotalmag**: Sum of the loudest `inumbins` magnitudes (amps) of the bins between `minfreq` and `maxfreq`

## Execution Time

* Performance
